#how to work with git
* new branch : specific name! only one goal to a branch.
* you make a new branch from the master branch ONLY.
* after you've completed the task - you got to Commit tab on the left of the webstorm.
* you check EVERY change you made, and see that it is EXACTLY what you wanted.
* When you've done checking you write a ONE SENTENCE message in the commit message with the title of the branch.
* Then, you TICK all the changes you want to commit to and press COMMIT.
* After that, you press Ctrl+A and write PULL, and Pull changes from the master branch.
* Then, you open the branch menu on the bottom right corner, You'll see the branch you're working on at the moment, and you press it, and then press PUSH.
* NOW, we move to the git - you'll see that a new action is available on the front page - "Compare & pull request".
* You validate that it is the same branch as the one you were working on.
* After pressing the button you will open a new MR, be as thorough as possible in the merge request description.
* You can submit the MR only after you validate EVERY CHANGE you've made.
* Submit the merge.
