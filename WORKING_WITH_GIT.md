#how to work with git
* new branch : specific name! only one goal to a branch.
* you make a new branch from the master branch ONLY.
* after you've completed the task - you got to Commit tab on the left of the webstorm.
* you check EVERY change you made, and see that it is EXACTLY what you wanted.
* When you've done checking you write a ONE SENTENCE message in the commit message with the title of the branch.
* Then, you TICK all the changes you want to commit to and press COMMIT.
